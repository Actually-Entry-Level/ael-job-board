              <p>"Every time I would visit LinkedIn, I would see my friends sharing posts about how frustrating it is that the supposedly entry-level jobs they were filtering for would end up still requiring 3-5 years experience. That's where the idea of Actuent came about."</p>

                How do we keep the lights on? Some of the links you get when you
                search with us have bids attached to them. When you click on
                those links, we get a kickback for the bid amount. We don't
                privilege paid links and we don't filter out unpaid links.
                That's it. We don't collect any of your information, let alone
                sell it. Find out more on our <a href="{{ url_for('privacy') }}">Privacy</a>
