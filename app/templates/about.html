                sharing posts about how frustrating it is that the supposedly
                entry-level jobs they were filtering for would end up still
                requiring 3-5 years experience. That's where the idea of
                Actuent came about."</p>

                "I had a frustrating time sifting through 'entry level' job
                listings that were anything but. Orton and I wished we had a
                site that implemented a filter without the need to share
                information or create an account and decided to make our own."

                How do we keep the lights on? Some of the links you get when you
                search with us have bids attached to them. When you click on
                those links, we get a kickback for the bid amount. We don't
                privilege paid links and we don't filter out unpaid links.
                That's it. We don't collect any of your information, let alone
                sell it. Find out more on our
